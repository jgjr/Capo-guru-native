# Capo guru
This is the repository for the React Native application that can be found on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.greenwoodlomax.capoguru).
Capo guru takes chord sequences and displays where else they can be played on a guitar using a capo.
All of the musical heavy-lifting is handled by [guitar-chord-sequence](https://github.com/jgjr/guitar-chord-sequence).

It was bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and uses the [react-native-material-ui](https://github.com/xotahal/react-native-material-ui) React UI framework.
